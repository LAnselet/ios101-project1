# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Yichen Sun**

**Wordle** is an app that in each round, player will be given a secret word to guess and a limited number of chances to do so. With each guess, you'll receive clues that indicate which letters are included in the word and where they're located. You aim to use these clues to guess the secret word before running out of attempts. [TODO]
